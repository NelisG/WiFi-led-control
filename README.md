# WiFi-led-control

* This repository contains the source code for the android app WiFi LED control. The app can be downloaded from the Google Play Store. 
* A template FLASK server (Python) is included in this repositroy and can be implemented for various LED projects with developer boards such as a Raspberry Pi.  
* The application sends simple POST requests with the color in hex-format (e.g. {"color": "ff00ff"}) to an URL/IP-address.
* The color wheel is based on Lars Werkman's Holo Colorpicker which can be found [here](https://github.com/LarsWerkman/HoloColorPicker).
